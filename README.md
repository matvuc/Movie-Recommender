# Movie-Recommender
Worked on a python based project that suggests 5 movies based on users preferences. Main libraries used in this project are Pandas adn Scikit-Learn. I leveraged cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectorization, and then the system analyzes movie overviews and genres to deliver personalized recommendations.

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn
Algorithm: TF-IDF Vectorization + Cosine Similarity
GUI Development (Upcoming): Tkinter, PyQt, or Streamlit
